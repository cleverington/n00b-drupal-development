# A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything

As Markdown is probably the single greatest tool for developers when writing instructional documents, what better way to introduce myself to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) then to actively write a book?

The second project, " **A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything** \(Or something like that...\)", is a project to leverage multiple long-term goals:

 + Build an understanding of the available tools within GitBook and GitHub,
 + Create a viable Study Guide for each of the the Acquia Certified Drupal Developer Exams:
   - Certified Drupal Site Builder
   - Certified Developer Exam
   - Certified Developer Back-End Specialist Exam
   - Certified Developer Front-End Specialist Exam
   - Any other Certifications as they come!
 + Have fun playing in Git and Authoring content.
