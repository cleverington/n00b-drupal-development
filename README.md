# A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything
#### By: Charles R. Leverington \(aka: Pedran\)

As Markdown is probably the single greatest tool for developers when writing instructional documents, what better way to introduce myself to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) then to actively write a book?

Drupal 5, Drupal 6, Drupal 7, and, now, Drupal 8 are all powerful platforms for cultivating, developing, and managing the ultimate User Experience. Other platforms such as Wordpress, Joomla, DotNetNuke, Ethereum, Ruby on Rails, and beyond all offer their unique approach to deployed User Experience platforms.

Here-to known as [d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org"), the Drupal.org Documentation is extensive, detailed, and \(at times\) as organized as a Frat Boy's bedroom. [The Drupal Cookbook for beginners](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/customization/tutorials/beginners-cookbook "The Drupal Cookbook for beginners"), for example, looks like a project put together by dozens of Remote Developers without collaboration, Version Control, or oversight.

Of course, **none** of that is true. 

Perception, as they say...

With the creeping Normalization across code libraries, platforms, and languages, it will not be long until web-development platforms like [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/ "Drupal") are equally as viable for cross-platform and gaming development as such as the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/ "Unity") or the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/ "Unreal Engine 4") \(**Hint:** *It is getting there now...* Play some SNES Mario: [Super Mario World](http://mario5.florian-rappl.de/#menu "Super Mario World") The creator made it entirely in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.\)

[d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org")'s Documentation pages need to rise to the occasion as well. Perhaps, in the future, this book may help with that.
