Drupal 5, Drupal 6, Drupal 7, and, now, Drupal 8 are all powerful platforms for cultivating, developing, and managing the ultimate User Experience. Support for Drupal 5 and 6 might have ended, but resources for each are still available if emerging Developers wish to dig into the 'History' of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org").

Other platforms such as Wordpress, Joomla, DotNetNuke, Ethereum, Ruby on Rails, and beyond all offer their unique approach to deployed User Experience platforms.

Here-to known as [d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org"), the Drupal.org Documentation is extensive, detailed, and \(at times\) as organized as a Frat Boy's bedroom. [The Drupal Cookbook for beginners](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/customization/tutorials/beginners-cookbook "The Drupal Cookbook for beginners"), for example, looks like a project put together by dozens of Remote Developers without collaboration, Version Control, or oversight.

Of course, **none** of that is true. 

Perception, as they say...

With the creeping Normalization across code libraries, platforms, and languages, it will not be long until web-development platforms like [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/ "Drupal") are equally as viable for cross-platform and gaming development as such as the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/ "Unity") or the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/ "Unreal Engine 4") \(**Hint:** *It is getting there now...* Play some SNES Mario: [Super Mario World](http://mario5.florian-rappl.de/#menu "Super Mario World") The creator made it entirely in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.\)

[d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org")'s Documentation pages need to rise to the occasion as well. Perhaps, in the future, this book may help with that.
