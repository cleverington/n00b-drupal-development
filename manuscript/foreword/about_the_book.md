# About this book

**Today?** This book is a work-in-progress. 

As mentioned in the previous section, there are multiple goals. If I get Contributors along the way? Great. If not? Great. This purpose of this book is not profit. It is more a personal manual and personal journal. 

+ If it can be written, it is known. 
+ If it is known, it is reproducible.
+ If it can be complicated, someone **will** do so.

**A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything** \(*Or something like that...*\), is a project to leverage multiple long-term goals:

 + Build an understanding of the available tools within:
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/ "Adam | A GitHub Project"),
  - [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/ "LeanPub"),
  - [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/ "GitBook | A GitHub Project"),
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub"), [Git](https://try.github.io/ "Try Git Free!"),
  - [Jeff Geerling's](http://jeffgeerling.com/ "Jeff Geerling's Website") [Drupal-Pi](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-pi "Drupal-Pi!"),
 + Create a viable Study Guide for each of the the Acquia Certified Drupal Developer Exams:
   - [Certified Drupal Site Builder](https://www.acquia.com/customer-success/learning-services/acquia-certified-drupal-site-builder-exam-blueprint "Acquia Certified Drupal Site Builder")
   - [Certified Developer Exam](https://www.acquia.com/customer-success/learning-services/acquia-certified-developer-exam-blueprint "Acquia Certified Developer")
   - [Certified Developer Back-End Specialist Exam](https://www.acquia.com/customer-success/learning-services/acquia-certified-developer-back-end-specialist-exam-blueprint "Acquia Certified Developer-Back end Specialist")
   - [Certified Developer Front-End Specialist Exam](https://www.acquia.com/customer-success/learning-services/acquia-certified-developer-front-end-specialist-exam-blueprint "Acquia Certified Developer - Front End Specialist")
   - Acquia Certified Grand Master Certification
    + Requires: Acquia Certified Developer Certification
    + Requires: Acquia Certified Developer – Front End Specialist Certification
    + Requires: Acquia Certified Developer – Back End Specialist Certification
   - Any other Certifications as they come!
 + Have fun playing in Git and Authoring content.
