# About this book

**Today?** This book is a work-in-progress. 

As mentioned on the Foreword, there are multiple goals. If I get Contributors along the way? Great. If not? Great. This purpose of this book is not profit. It is more a personal manual and personal journal. 

+ If it can be written, it is known. 
+ If it is known, it is reproducible.

**A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything** \(*Or something like that...*\), is a project to leverage multiple long-term goals:

 + Build an understanding of the available tools within GitBook and GitHub,
 + Create a viable Study Guide for each of the the Acquia Certified Drupal Developer Exams:
   - Certified Drupal Site Builder
   - Certified Developer Exam
   - Certified Developer Back-End Specialist Exam
   - Certified Developer Front-End Specialist Exam
   - Any other Certifications as they come!
 + Have fun playing in Git and Authoring content.

 The 'final' product will likely be a set of serialized volumes, each detailing a specific role and growth for prospective Devs and Admins.
