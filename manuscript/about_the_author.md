Howdy.

As a Texan, I am told (often) I pretty much have to start with Howdy. Also, no, we do not check our horses at the border.

My name, as you might have guessed, is Charles Leverington (aka: Pedran or cleverington).

I am a near-Fanatical Drupalist, (Self-Declared) Philosopher, Web Efficiency Designer, Aspiring Author, Think-tank, and Quality Specialist. I have worked for over a decade in both Quality Assurance and Online Development. I also has experience with design and customer module development in Drupal 6, Drupal 7, Drupal Gardens, and Drupal 8.

To date, I have:
- been a Contributor or Developer for three published websites
- run the gauntlet of Full-Stack Drupal design and deployment for a project-wide Intranet
- co-authored a Drupal 7 101 course
- taught aforementioned course at Austin Community College (ACC) in Fall of 2016
- performed *loads* of Drupal 7 tasks (including six simultaneous Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 Migrations) as Senior Developer / Analyst at UT's Moody College of Communication
- ran lead developer for the Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup's GitHub Pages website at https://drupaldiversity.github.io
- (and) am writing this book (via GitBook and LeanPub) while updating Drupal 7 101 Curriculum

I have written various fiction short stories, novellas, and even a couple of novels over the last decade and published a few in-progress fan fiction works on FanFiction.net \(aka: [Pedran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/164598/Pedran "Pedran's FanFiction Pad") \).

If there's a mistake, let me know.
If I can make it better, let me know.

This book is a journey and I do not plan on taking it alone.
