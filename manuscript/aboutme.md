# About the author

Howdy. As a Texan, I'm told (often) that I pretty much have to start with Howdy. Also, no, we do not check our horses at the border.

My name, as you might have guessed, is Charles Leverington (aka: Pedran). I am a near-Fanatical Drupalist, (Self-Declared) Philosopher, Web Efficiency Designer, Aspiring Author, Think-tank, and Quality Specialist. I have worked for over a decade in both Quality Assurance and Online Development. I also has experience with design and customer module development in Drupal 6, Drupal 7, Drupal Gardens, and (soon) Drupal 8. To date, I have been a Contributor or Developer for three published websites and one Full-Stack Drupal design and deployment for a project-wide Intranet.

I have written various fiction short stories, novellas, and even a couple of novels over the last decade and published a few in-progress fan fiction works on FanFiction.net \(aka: [Pedran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/164598/Pedran "Pedran FanFiction Pad") \). 

# About this book

**Today?** This book is a work-in-progress. 

As mentioned on the Foreword, there are multiple goals. If I get Contributors along the way? Great. If not? Great. This purpose of this book is not profit. It is more a personal manual and personal journal. 

+ If it can be written, it is known. 
+ If it is known, it is reproducible.

If there's a mistake, let me know.
If I can make it better, let me know.

This book is a journey and I do not plan on taking it alone.
