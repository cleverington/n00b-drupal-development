# About the author

Howdy. As a Texan, I pretty much have to start with Howdy.

My name, as you might have guessed, is Charles Leverington (aka: Pedran). I am a near-Fantical Drupalist, (Self-Declared) Philosopher, Web Efficiency Designer, Aspiring Author, Think-tank, and Quality Specialist. I have worked for over a decade in both Quality Assurance and Online Development. I also has experience with design and customer module development in Drupal 6, Drupal 7, Drupal Gardens, and (soon) Drupal 8. To date, I have been a Contributer or Developer for three published websites and one Full-Stack Drupal design and deployment for a project-wide Intranet.

I have written various fiction short stories, novellas, and even a couple of novels over the last decade and published a few in-progress fan fiction works on FanFiction.net \(aka: [Pedran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/164598/Pedran "Pedran FanFiction Pad") \). 

# About this book

Today? This book is a work-in-progress. As mentioned on the Foreword, there are multiple goals. If I get Contributers along the way? Great. If not? Great. This book is not going to be written for any sort of profit, but more a personal manual and personal journal. If it can be written, it is known. If it is known, it is reproduceable.

If there's a mistake, let me know.
If I can make it better, let me know.

This book is a journey and I do not plan on taking it alone.
