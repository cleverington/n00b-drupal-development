# Stay For The Community

The Drupal Community is, in a word, **massive**.

More importantly, it is *friendly* and filled with **great people**.

I cannot re-inforce this enough. Drupal = Good people and a great community.

Most documentation on [d.o](https://www.drupal.org "Drupal.org") tends to avoid directly name-dropping, but I will do so here so that you, as a new entrant to the community, can understand just *why* Drupal has survived the rise and fall of more than a few competitors over the years and remains strong to this day.

# Drupal Camp: Austin - 2011:

Having been learning Drupal for a few years from @illepic, I decided to attend my first 'convention' to experience the "Community" a little better. This plan worked out well as Drupal Camp Austin happened less than two months later in November 2011.

Imagine, if you will, a lone Developer armed with nothing but a labtop and a love of Drupal walking in to a Convention with **thousands** of Drupalistas and Drupalleros without even the courtesy of a Wingman.

The first person I met, while walking in the door, is a friendly guy named Chris, who walked with me up to the [Four Kitchens](https://fourkitchens.com/ "Four Kitchens") booth, where I learned about the Camp line-up, tutorials, free resources, and best places 'to be'. Chris, as it turned out, is rupl, a really good HTML/CSS guru I had already been learning from. \(Really good as in rupl was one of the largest contributers for the module [Modernizr](https://www.drupal.org/project/modernizr "Module | Modernizr"), which has be integrated into Drupal 8 Core because of how ridiculously awesome it is. \)

Then I went to my first live tutorial where a rather detailed speech was given on Responsive theming, the Omega theme, and the growing support for HTML 5 across the Web Development community. 

Or, well, I tried to. I really did.

Unfortunately, I got turned around and ended up in an empty room where I met a nice, unassuming, and totally friendly Drupalista named 'Angie'. Angie escorted me across the building while recommending three books, five people to follow on Twitter, four websites to learn from, a full learning progression path, *and* explained the difference between 'Responsive' and 'Reflexive'. The whole conversation took about three or four minutes, but I spent half the session on Responsive Theme Design on making notes from what Angie said instead.

Then, on a lark, I looked up 'Angie' for the Drupal Camp participants. Turns out, she's kinda 'big' in Drupal. Drupal Association's Secretary, an Acquia employee, kick-started the CVS to Git migration \(you'll learn those words later\), and, oh yeah, was interviewed by [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/ "The Economist") once on her Drupal knowledge.
