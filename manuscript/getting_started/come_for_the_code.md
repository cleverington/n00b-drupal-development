# Come For The Code

**Is Drupal Secure?**

The first question asked by any \(good\) Web Developer, Designer, Administrator, or Site Builder should always be and, for the most part, has always been: Is it safe?

The short-answer is: *Why Yes! Yes, of course it is!*

The long-answer is: Longer.

[The Drupal Security Team](https://www.drupal.org/security-team "The Drupal Security Team") has around the clock monitoring of any and all Security Issues with Drupal Core, contributed Modules, and contributed Themes. In addition, all Modules and Themes go through [rigorous testing](https://www.drupal.org/automated-testing/faq). On top of that, Drupal projects are created, updated, corrected, commented, fixed, and published using a very powerful version control system named [Git](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/git). More on Git later.
