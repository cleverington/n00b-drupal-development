# Using This Book

### Content

**A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything** \(*Or something like that...*\) is, as mentioned previously, written to be a *journey*. It is up to **you**, the Reader, to choose **your** path.

The goal of the book design is for each Volume and Chapter to be roughly stand-alone. Chapters, Sections, and pages will continually be updated throughout the publication and development of the book to ensure consistency and smooth transitions between knowledge.

[d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org") is a treasure-trove of information, but only if you can navigate the quagmire therein. One of the primary goals of this book is to first include and then incorporate the vast reservoir of knowledge within [d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org"). Finally, the knowledge would be *presented* in the most logical and organized manner the Author can manage.

The original publication of the n00b's Guide assumes the Reader is developing in either Drupal 7 or Drupal 8, unless specified otherwise. Each Drupal-centric chapter will eventually have three (or more) sections: Drupal 8, Drupal 7, and Drupal 6. The number of future sections may even grow to incorporate specific instructions for Drupal Distributions such as [Commerce Kickstart](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart "d.o | Commerce Kickstart"), [Open Atrium](https://www.drupal.org/project/openatrium "d.o | Open Atrium"), and [Opigno LMS](https://www.drupal.org/project/opigno_lms "d.o | Opigno LMS").

### Design

This book is written using the altogether awesome language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics "Daring Fireball").

Markdown was authored by John Gruber as an easy and fast text-to-HTML tool for web writers. One \# is H1 and actively translates to straight HTML when rendered. For the 'Raw' text of this book, visit my GitHub page.

``` html
 Blocks of code, as seen later, will look like this.
 <html> 
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <footer>
  </footer>
 </html>

```

As seen, little random quotes and important definitions will be in a block like this:
> "Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please." ~ Mark Twain

Most times, if you find it in a block-quote and it is a definition, it is *very* important to remember long-term.
