## Audience - Sections to Read
Employers nowadays always ask for "Full Stack" Developers.

However, no-one in their right mind tries to go "Full Stack" while learning. It is better instead to focus on one aspect or another while reaching for that **utterly impossible** objective of Full Stack Developer.

### Audience Role

This guide will have a small section at the beginning of each page for *'Audience'*:
- FrontEnd Developer
- BackEnd Developer
- Builder
- Maintainer
- Administrator
- DevOps

Traditionally, the Roles have been *Site Builder*, *Site Maintainer*, and *Site Administrator*. In the RESTful API world of Drupal 8 (more on this later), the titles may not *ever* refers to 'Sites'.

### Audience Rank

Additionally, the 'n00b level' will give a little detail on how complicated the knowledge is. Though all knowledge will *attempt* to be presented in total-n00b friendly fashion, sometimes it just is not.

1. Elite n00b
2. Advanced n00b
3. Confident n00b
4. n00b

At the rate technology changes, we're all n00bs.

I kinda like it that way.


## Content
**A n00b's Guide to Drupal, Development, & Everything** \(*Or something like that...*\) is, as mentioned previously, written to be a *journey*. It is up to **you**, the Reader, to choose **your** path.

The goal of the book design is for each Volume and Chapter to be roughly stand-alone. Chapters, Sections, and pages will continually be updated throughout the publication and development of the book to ensure consistency and smooth transitions between knowledge.

[d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org") is a treasure-trove of information and is gloriously not **nearly** the quagmire of horror and nightmares it once was. One of the primary goals of this book *at its inception* was to first include and then incorporate the vast reservoir of knowledge within [d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org"). Finally, the knowledge would be *presented* in the most logical and organized manner the Author can manage.  Thankfully, however, Drupal's [Documentation Working Group](https://www.drupal.org/governance/doc-working-group "Documentation Working Group") instead took 

The original publication of the n00b's Guide assumes the Reader is developing in either Drupal 7 or Drupal 8, unless specified otherwise. Each Drupal-centric chapter will eventually have three (or more) sections: Drupal 8 Drupal 7. The number of future sections may even grow to incorporate specific instructions for Drupal Distributions such as [Commerce Kickstart](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart "d.o | Commerce Kickstart"), [Open Atrium](https://www.drupal.org/project/openatrium "d.o | Open Atrium"), and [Opigno LMS](https://www.drupal.org/project/opigno_lms "d.o | Opigno LMS").

Drupal 6 was originally going to be addressed. However, the Drupal 6 CMS has become so deprecated that it would not be worth the time to write. Many parts of Drupal 7 will also be phased out and, where appropriate, only the Drupal 8 version will be shown.

## Design

This book is written using the altogether awesome language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics "Daring Fireball").

Markdown was authored by John Gruber as an easy and fast text-to-HTML tool for web writers. One \# is H1 and actively translates to straight HTML when rendered. For the 'Raw' text of this book, visit my GitHub page.

```html
 Blocks of code, as seen later, will look like this.
 <html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <footer>
  </footer>
 </html>

```

As seen, little random quotes and important definitions will be in a block like this:
> "Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please." ~ Mark Twain

Most times, if you find it in a block-quote and it is a definition, it is *very* important to remember long-term.
