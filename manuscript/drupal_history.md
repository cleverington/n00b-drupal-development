## Dries Buytaert

If you have started to read on or research Drupal in the slightest, one of the first names you will come across is [Dries Buytaert](http://buytaert.net "Dries").

Dries invented Drupal. Plain as that.

But it goes further than that. Many Content Management System (CMS) platforms have risen and fallen in the last three decades.

So what is so special and different about **this** Nerd that he was invited to [meet with the King and Queen of Belgium](http://buytaert.net/dries-meets-the-king-and-queen-of-belgium "Dries met the Queen ")
