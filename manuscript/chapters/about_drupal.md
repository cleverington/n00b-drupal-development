# About Drupal

**Build something amazing, for anyone, anywhere.**

Drupal, as defined at [d.o](https://www.drupal.org/about "About") is "content management software". 

This definition, however, only breaches what **Core** Drupal offers.

With the exensibility provided by modules such as [Views](https://www.drupal.org/project/views "Views") and the [Chaos Tool Suite](https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools "ctools"), Drupal 7 stomped into the realm of web application development like a T-Rex carrying a foundation built on Security, Community Support, and smooth expansions. 

In truth, Drupal is better defined as a User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) platform. From online video-games to deep research web-applications, the only limitations placed on Drupal Developers is what they (and their clients) can imagine. Unfortunately, that name is far to combersome and most non-Developers probably won't understand what "UI/UX Platform" means. 

Drupal, like many other open source software, is distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License (GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html "GPL").
