# Foreword

Here-to known as [d.o](https://www.drupal.org/ "drupal.org"), the Drupal.org Documentation is extensive, detailed, and \(at times\) as organized as a Frat Boy's bedroom. [The Drupal Cookbook for beginners](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/customization/tutorials/beginners-cookbook "The Drupal Cookbook for beginners"), for example, looks like a project put together by dozens of Remote Developers without collaboration, Version Control, or oversight.

Yet, the Documentation has useful gems as well: 
 + [Drupal 7 - The Essentials](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/the-essentials-7 "Drupal 7 Essentials") 
  - This lovely gem was added via the Creative Commons license to drupal.org in May 2012. For Developers transferring their current knowledge-base into Drupal-Development, this book is amazing. Unfortunately, the book also makes a number of assumptions, such as Development being done in a Drupal 7 environment.  
 + [The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/node/1849904 "The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7") 
  - This gem was likewise published on Dorg via Creative Commons \(albeit without Clean URLs\).
 + [The Drupal Cookbook (for beginners)](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/customization/tutorials/beginners-cookbook "The Drupal Cookbook (for beginners)")
  - The Beginner's Guide was, at one point, a useful journey for Beginner and Novice level Administrators, Site Builders, DevOps, and SysOps for 'How to Start Drupal'. I \(the author)\ actually contributed a number of pages to the build in 2011. As it is now, however, 

As opposed to the two books named (which should be read extensively) the aim of the n00b's guide is to cultivate aspiring Web Developers, Administrators, and Site Builders through a carefully aligned journey.

By happy coincidence, the journey \(roughly\) matches the Core Competencies as detailed by Acquia's Drupal Certification Study Guides. 

# Note

This book is both a work-in-progress (WIP) and a research driven commitment to **Novice Level** Drupal, Front-End Development, Back-End Development, Ansible, VNWare, Drush, etc. knowledge aggregation. 

It is not, and will never be, for example, [The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7](http://definitivedrupal.org/ "The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7: Configuration, Code, and Community"). I cheerfully take zero responsibility for faults or mistakes in this book and will just as cheerfully accept comments, Contribs, etc.
