# Drupal Learning Resources

Designing, Prototyping, Cultivating, and Presenting a unified User Experience is as much a journey for the Developer as it is for the Front-End Designers, Back-End Designers, DevOps, and SysOps.

The following pages contain a **small** number of references beyond this book where learning magic can happen. They have, for the most part, been presented in 'learning order'. That said, one does not need to know **any** Javascript to become a Drupal Site Builder and the HTML/CSS knowledge requirements are small at-best.
