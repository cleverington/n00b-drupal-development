# Getting Started

The first thing to understand when starting a journey towards a future as a Web Developer, Web Designer, SysOps, SysAdmin, DevOps, etc., etc. is to understand **your own** long-term goals.

This book will help provide resources, information, references, and possibly lots of name-dropping for some of the biggest names in [Drupal](https://drupal.org "Drupal"), Web Development, Web Design, and IT Automation.

What this book will *not* do is help you, the reader, understand your best path to **your** personal goals. I can only outline a path, it is up to you to decide where your steps take you.
