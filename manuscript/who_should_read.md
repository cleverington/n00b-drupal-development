1. In the Long-Run: Newbs, Mid-terms, and \(in the long run\) **all** Drupalistas and Drupalleros.
2. Soon: Newbs. Scoot before crawl, crawl before walk, and walk before run.
3. Now: Yeah... Nobody. The first chapter is only two-thirds done.

As mentioned in the Foreword, the Drupal Documentation pages are clunky, less than user friendly, and, in **many** places, more all over the board than political views on Marx.

Perhaps, in the future, the n00b's guide can provide a solid alternative.
