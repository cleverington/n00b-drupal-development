# Foreword

The Drupal.org Documentation is extensive, detailed, and as organized as a Frat Boy's bedroom. [The Drupal Cookbook for beginners](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/customization/tutorials/beginners-cookbook "The Drupal Cookbook for beginners"), for example, looks like a project put together by dozens of Remote Developers without Version Control or oversight.

Yet, the Documentation has useful gems as well: 
 * [Drupal 7 - The Essentials](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/the-essentials-7 "Drupal 7 Essentials") is a lovely gem added via the Creative Commons license to drupal.org in May 2012. 
 * [The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/node/1849904 "The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7") was likewise publish on drupal.org via Creative Commons \(albeit without Clean URLs\).

As opposed to the two books named (which should be read extensively) the aim of the n00b's guide is to cultivate aspiring Web Developers, Administrators, and Site Builders through a carefully aligned journey.

By happy coincidence, the journey \(roughly\) matches the Core Competencies as detailed by Acquia's Drupal Certification Study Guides. 

# Note

This book is both a work-in-progress (WIP) and a research driven committment to **Novice Level** Drupal, Front-End Development, Back-End Development, Ansible, VNWare, Drush, etc. knowledge aggregation. 

It is not, and will never be, for example, [The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7](http://definitivedrupal.org/ "The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7: Configuration, Code, and Community"). I cheerfully take zero responsibility for faults or mistakes in this book and will just as cheefully accept comments, Contribs, etc.
