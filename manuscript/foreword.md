### Final Wordcount

This book was originally inspired by @NaNoWriMo, but took on a life of its own when compared against how much sheer **knowledge** needing to be imparted exists. Drupal has a long, rich, and vibrant history. Writing anything less than a long, rich, and vibrant introductional guide does it no justice.

Despite goals, notes, and two half-compositions notebooks worth of research, tutorial addresses, video feeds, and software crash-testing, the final wordcount on 11/30/2015 at 11:59pm was only 6,259 words. Considering my other book is pushing 30,000 words (though unpublished), I am satisfied with this.

## Foreword

As opposed to the books referenced below \(which should be read extensively\) the aim of the n00b's guide is to cultivate aspiring Web Developers, Administrators and Site Builders through a carefully aligned journey.

By happy coincidence, the journey \(roughly\) matches the Core Competencies as detailed by Acquia's Drupal Certification Study Guides.

# Other Resources

The Documentation has useful gems:
 + [d.o | Drupal 7 - The Essentials](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/the-essentials-7 "Drupal 7 Essentials")
  - This lovely gem was added via the Creative Commons license to drupal.org in May 2012. For Developers transferring their current knowledge-base into Drupal-Development, this book is amazing. Unfortunately, the book also makes a number of assumptions, such as Development being done in a Drupal 7 environment and Developers knowing *exactly* what they are doing like Code Ninjas for everything not directly Drupal.
 + [d.o | The Drupal Cookbook (for beginners)](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/customization/tutorials/beginners-cookbook "The Drupal Cookbook (for beginners)")
  - The Beginner's Guide was, at one point, a useful journey for Beginner and Novice level Administrators, Site Builders, DevOps, and SysOps for 'How to Start Drupal'. I \(the author\) actually contributed a number of pages to the build in 2011. As it is now, however...
 + [d.o | User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide "Drupal 8 User Guide")
  - [DRAFT User Guide](https://userguide-drupal.redesign.devdrupal.org/d8guide/en/index.html "DRAFT User Guide") - User/Pass: drupal/drupal - Currently in *very* draft status, the Drupal 8 User Guide aims to be a 'new and improved' version of the Drupal Documentation.
  - More information as it becomes available.

#### Note

This book is both a work-in-progress (WIP) and a research driven commitment to **Novice Level** Drupal, Front-End Development, Back-End Development, Ansible, VNWare, Drush, etc. knowledge aggregation.

It is not, and will never be, for example, [The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7](http://definitivedrupal.org/ "The Definitive Guide to Drupal 7: Configuration, Code, and Community"). I cheerfully take zero responsibility for faults or mistakes in this book and will just as cheerfully accept comments, Contribs, etc.
