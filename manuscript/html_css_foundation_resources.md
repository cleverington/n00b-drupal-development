### Ruby
 * Installing Ruby was at one point a long and difficult process on a Windows machine, but no longer! Simply pick up the [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/ "Ruby Installer"), then follow the instructions to install.
 * Next, download the Development Kit best associated with your current system. \(Located on the same page.\)
 * Unzip the Development Kit in a localized directory, ```C:\DevKit\``` for example.
 * Open a Windows Command Prompt with Administrator access and enter the following commands:
  - ```ruby -v``` - This is a text command, your prompt should return something like 'ruby 2.0.0p353' or similar
 * Update your version of Ruby via: ```gem update --system```
 * That's it! You are up and running!

 * **Ruby Gems**
  * ```gem install compass``` - Installs Compass for Development with Sass, Compass, Foundation, etc.
  * ```gem install rails``` - Installs Rails \(For [Ruby on Rails Development]() \)
