# {{ book.chapters.getting_started }}

The first thing to understand when starting a journey towards a future as a Web Developer, Web Designer, SysOps, SysAdmin, DevOps, etc., etc. is to understand **your own** long-term goals.

This book will help provide resources, information, references, and possibly lots of name-dropping for some of the biggest names in [Drupal](https://drupal.org "Drupal"), Web Development, Web Design, and IT Automation.

What this book will *not* do is help you, the reader, understand your best path to **your** personal goals. I can only outline a path, it is up to you to decide where your steps take you.

# In This Chapter

The focus of this chapter is *knowledge*.

If you are ready, willing & able to dive right in and start a website, feel free to jump forward to Chapter 3, 4, or even (where your first site is created) Chapter 5.

For those of you still reading (and thank you for that), I will reiterate something here that you'll see many, *many* times over in this book:
> Come for the Code, Stay for the Community

If you learn nothing else from my book, learn that support is available for all skill levels at any time, anywhere.
