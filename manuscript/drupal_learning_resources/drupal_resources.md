  * Pantheon.io
   * **Pantheon.io** provides second-to-none Drupal hosting and breached the world of WordPress hosting in March 2014. One of the best selling-points for hosting with Pantheon is their automatic-updates and patches. As a Developer, Pantheon takes most DevOps necessities entirely out of the hands of end-users. This allows Developers to focus on building *content* instead of building *Drupal*.
