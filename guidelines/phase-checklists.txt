[[phase-checklists-writing]]
==== Issue template and checklist for initial writing

Use the following issue summary template for issues for writing individual
topics. You'll need to replace the following:

* Before you start making issues, put in the URL for <<copyright-license>> where
it says [COPYRIGHT-LINK] and the URL for <<practicalities-writing-phase>> where
it says [QUICK-START-LINK].

* For each issue, the things like [TOPIC TITLE] need to be replaced with actual
information for the topic.

<h3>Task for this issue</h3>

Write the following topic.

<strong>Title:</strong>  [TOPIC TITLE]
<strong>Section:</strong> [BOOK SECTION NAME]

<h3>Instructions</h3>

See [QUICK-START-LINK]

<h3>Checklist for this task</h3>
- Does it follow the template?
- Have the comments and placeholder text been removed from the template?
- If sections of the template are not needed, are they still there but turned into comments?
- Is everything the topic was supposed to cover included, and nothing extra?
- If there are @todo notes, are they clear?
- If there are images included, do they include instructions for how to redo them in a comment? (Note: Screenshots do not need to be perfect. Just make a rough cut.)

[[phase-checklists-guidelines]]
==== Checklists for guidelines and formatting

After making a commit for the writing phase, the committing project manager
should check for adherence the following guidelines (rather than requiring that
the writer has followed them). If there are problems, the committer can either
file an issue to get another volunteer to make updates, or do the edits directly
and commit the changes.

Guidelines checklist:

* Does it follow our guidelines for good writing? See <<good-writing>>.

* Does it speak to the intended audience?

* Does it follow the scenario and use the provided text/image assets? See <<follow-scenario>>.

* Does it have appropriate index entries?

* Is the navigation described in the standard way? See <<text-navigation>>.

Next, rebuild the guide (or wait for the automatic build to happen) and check
the output, as well as the source file, for formatting. Check for formatting
issues, and fix them with a commit (this is recommended, rather than filing an
issue and asking for a volunteer to fix the problems).

Formatting checklist:

* The formatting of the headers, subheaders, lists, etc. works (no wrong
numbers, etc.).

* Images do not spill out of margins; narrow images are not artificially widened
(you may need to take out or add +,width="100%"+ in image tags).

* Images are named appropriately. For source file _my-filename.txt_, the file
name should be _my-filename-short-description.png_.

* Text should be wrapped in lines going out to around 80-characters, without
going over, as much as possible. However, lines specifying images, links,
and the like can go over 80 characters to keep the image/link, including
attributes, all together on one line.

* When formatting a bullet list or numbered list, within each list item,
subsequent lines should start at the left margin. Paragraph breaks within a
list item are generated by + signs. Example:

----
. This is a numbered list item. After reaching the 80 character
line length, the next line starts at the left margin.
+
And this is a second paragraph within the same list item.
----

* All of the sections from the appropriate template should be present in both
Task and Concept topics. If they are empty, they should be commented out:

----
// ==== Site prerequisites
----

* Within a particular section, such as Steps, if a sub-heading is needed, it
uses ===== notation rather than just being a sentence in bold or some ad-hoc
formatting like that.

* We don't need a heading at the top of Steps that just repeats the Goal. Just
remove it.

* Bullet lists should never have just one item. Take out the bullet if so and
make it a normal paragraph.


[[phase-checklists-testing]]
==== Checklist for testing

Here is a checklist for what testers could look for in testing sessions (you
might post this list somewhere or hand out copies):

* Do the concept topics make sense?

* Is terminology defined the first time it is used?

* Are concepts introduced in Concept topics (not in Task topics)?

* Are the steps in Task topics clear, and do they work if you follow the steps
exactly as written?

* Are the instructions in the steps presented in both text (with tables for
filling out forms) and images (screen shots)?

* Does the user interface text mentioned in the steps match what you see in the
actual user interface?

* Does the navigation get you to the desired page, and is the final URL
specified in the navigation text correct?

* Are the knowledge and site prerequisites listed for each topic adequate?


[[phase-checklists-copyedit-task]]
==== Issue template for copy editing by task

Use this issue template for issues about copy editing the entire guide for one
specific guideline. You'll need to replace the following:

* Before you start making issues, put in the URL for <<copyright-license>> where
it says [COPYRIGHT-LINK] and the URL for <<practicalities-editing-by-task>>
where it says [QUICK-START-LINK]. Also put the name of the project, such as User
Guide, where it says [PROJECT-NAME].

* For each issue, put the guideline and specific instructions where it says
[GUIDELINE HERE]. An example guideline for this type of issue:
....
In the text of the guide, use "website" instead of "web site".
....

Issue summary template:
