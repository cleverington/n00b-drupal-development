=== Style Guide for the Editing Phase

The sections below contain a style guide to be used during the copy editing
phase.

The guidelines here are partially based on:

* https://www.drupal.org/style-guide/content[Drupal.org Style Guide]
* https://www.drupal.org/node/604342[Drupal.org Interface text conventions page]

[[guidelines-editing-tasks]]
==== Guidelines appropriate for single-task issues

The following style guidelines can be applied by volunteers, where each
volunteer would undertake the task of applying one guideline (independent of the
others, and across the entire project_name):

* Make sure that the *Goal section* in task topics is expressed as a specific
goal for the site, not as the learning goal or something generic. For instance
it should be "Add a content type for vendors to the site" not "Learn how to add
a content type to the site" or "Add a content type". Also it should not start
with "The goal ...", but should start with a verb.

* Make sure that the *Site prerequisites section* in task topics is expressed as
what you need to have on your site, not as steps or tasks. So for instance, it
should say that a certain module must be installed, or that a content type
must exist, rather than saying "Install a given module". Also it should link
to topics that tell how to achieve the prerequisite.

* When providing instructions for *interacting with the user interface*, use the
following styles. For clicking on a link or button, use the phrase "Click (link
or button text)", rather than "click on", "select", or other terms. For a
drop-down list or radio button, say "Select (choice)". For a checkbox, say
"Check (choice)". Make sure that the actual UI text you are selecting or
clicking on is in italics.

* If a step in a task includes a *screenshot*, it should go after the
description of how to do the step. If there is also a table of values for
filling out the form, the screenshot should go after the table of
values. Screenshots should always have alternate text, but should not have
captions. The alternate text should NOT start with "screenshot" or "screen
capture" or "image". It should describe what is in the image.

* *Referring to a module, installation profile, or theme* -- use a style like:
"the Contextual Links module", "the Bartik theme", or "the Standard installation
profile". No italics. Also, capitalize the module name (like "the Views module")
but not the "things" it works with (like "you can create views of your data").

* *Index entries* should be singular ("block" not "blocks"), and have
duplication and synonyms consolidated into one entry. They shouldn't have any
quote marks when they're listed in the output.

* *Links to topics* (internal links) should generally have link text equal to
the topic title. The link text can be overridden in a paragraph as long as the
link text still makes it clear that the link is going to a topic, but it is
preferable to say something like "See ____ [leaving topic name as the link] for
more information".

* When making a *link to an outside URL*, make sure the link text tells the
reader what web site it is going to:

** Link text to use when linking to one page within a larger site -- examples:

*** Wikipedia page "Cross-Site Scripting"
*** Drupal.org community documentation page "Installing Drupal"
*** Blog post "All About Views"
*** YouTube video "Setting up a View"

** Link text to use when linking to an entire web site or major site section --
examples:

*** groups.drupal.org, api.drupal.org, Drupal.org [the site URL without the
https etc.]

*** Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, JQuery Documentation, Drupal.org Community
Documentation [the name of the site or large section within a site]

* Avoid using *the word "Drupal"*, except when referring specifically to the
Drupal open-source project, the Drupal community, or the Drupal.org web
site. Instead, refer to "your site" and "the core software".

* Avoid mentioning *specific Drupal versions*, such as Drupal 7 or 8.

* Avoid the words *please, congratulations, be sure to, just, simply, or
thank you* (and similar words). Instead, tell the reader what they need to do.

* Avoid using *"we" and "I"*.

* *Upgrade vs. Update*: Upgrade means changing the software version from one
major version of Drupal to another, and adapting the site, database, and code to
this new version. Update is anything less than that, such as moving to a new
version of a particular module or the core software.

* *email vs. e-mail*: use email

* *website vs. web site*: use website

* *enable vs. install vs. upload*: In Drupal 8 and beyond, we are not using the
term "enable" any more for modules/themes. The correct term is "install". And
we shouldn't use the word "install" when we're talking about uploading module
or theme files, only when we're talking about turning on a module/theme (say
"copy files" or "upload files" instead.

* *directory vs. folder*: use directory.

* *contrib vs. contributed*: Refer to contributed modules and themes as
"contributed", not "contrib". However, they can be placed in a directory
called "contrib" in your modules/themes folder.

* *File names, URLs, and directories* should be in italics. For URLs within the
reader's site, use base URL example.com. See <<style-literals>> for formatting
instructions.

* *Commands typed at a command prompt* should be in monospace. See
<<style-literals>> for formatting instructions.

* *Things you can see in the Drupal user interface*: use the exact words
that someone would see in the UI, with their exact capitalization, and put the
UI words in italic typeface. See <<style-literals>> for formatting instructions.

* Every *list* should be preceded by either a header or a colon ( : ). List
items that are sentences end in period ( . ); list items that are not
sentences do not end in period ( . ). Lists with only one item should be turned
into regular paragraphs.

* Use *double-quotes*, except for quotes-within-quotes.


[[guidelines-editing-overall]]
==== Guidelines not appropriate for single-task issues

The following guidelines should be applied by having a person or people edit
each topic so that it follows all of the guidelines:

* Generally, use standard *American English* (with standard American English
usage, spelling, and punctuation). For standard usage, see _The Elements of
Style_ (Strunk and White) and/or _The Chicago Manual of Style_. If you use a
spellchecker, make sure that it is set to American English (en-us).

* Write in *second person, active voice, and imperative mood* as much as
possible (aside from Site Prerequisites, which are passive voice). Examples:
Click the _Add new content_ link, your site.

* Use the *serial comma* for lists inside sentences. Example: apples, oranges,
and pears.

* Follow the guidelines in <<good-writing>>.

* Follow the guidelines in <<follow-scenario>> (mainly for task topics) and
<<guidelines-writing>>; these should have been enforced during the writing
phase.

* When introducing new terminology for the first time, put the term in italic
typeface, and define it in parentheses or in a regular sentence. Also make
sure the terms are in the glossary topic.
