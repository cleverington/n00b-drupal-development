// Chapters should be defined here, and each one should include the individual
// topic files that make up the chapter, in order.

// The files in this guidelines file are supposed to be fairly generic. The hope
// is that someone starting a new documentation project that is using AsciiDoc
// source in a Drupal.org project and with similar management using issues would
// just need to:
// - Copy the files from this directory.
// - Make a new management.txt file (this tells about the project personnel and
//   communication channels).
// - Make a new ../scripts/guidelines.conf file (this has variable substitutions
//   used throughout the files included here).
