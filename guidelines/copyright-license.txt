==== Contributing original writing

You should adapt or copy existing work (with appropriate license as described
below) whenever possible rather than writing completely new text.

*When you contribute your original writing to this project, you agree that it
will be licensed under the project_license license.* To recognize your
contribution and acknowledge your copyright, provide your name on the
issue for the task you are submitting, and the project managers will add it to
the attributions file for the project. You may also add the name of an
organization or company that sponsored your work. You may turn both your name
and your organization/company name into links; the suggested link for your name
would be your Drupal.org user profile, but you may use a different URL if you
prefer.
