Also known as version control, source control, or revision control. Version Control Systems (VCS) add a text-based layer of maintaining *all*changes within an interative design process. Each time the document is 'saved' to the repository, the save is given a unique identifier that allows a Developer to fall back to (or before) that specific save. Newer systems, like {{ book.glossary.git }}.
