The application includes a content management platform and a development framework, which is extensible enough to be used for many projects including game development, financial accounting, and more.

Also known as version control, source control, or revision control. Version Control Systems (VCS) add a text-based layer of maintaining *all*changes within an interative design process. Each time the document is 'saved' to the repository, the save is given a unique identifier that allows a Developer to fall back to (or before) that specific save. Newer systems, like {{ book.glossary.git }}.
