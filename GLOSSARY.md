# Glossary

# {{ book.glossary.drupal }}
Drupal is a software that can be used by individuals or groups of users -- even those lacking technical skills -- to easily create and manage many types of Web sites. The application includes a content management platform and a development framework, which is extensible enough to be used for many projects including game development, financial accounting, and more.

# {{ book.glossary.git }}
Git is a {{ book.glossary.vcs }} used by the Drupal Community.

# {{ book.glossary.vcs }}
Also known as version control, source control, or revision control. Version Control Systems (VCS) add a text-based layer of maintaining *all*changes within an interative design process. Each time the document is 'saved' to the repository, the save is given a unique identifier that allows a Developer to fall back to (or before) that specific save. Newer systems, like {{ book.glossary.git }}.

# {{ book.glossary.drush }}
From their website at docs.drush.org/en/master: Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

# {{ book.glossary.drupalconsole }}
In a much more simplistic defintion then Drush, and from *their* website at drupalconsole.com, Drupal Console is: The Drupal CLI. A tool to generate boilerplate code, interact with and debug Drupal. Note the lack of an Oxford comma. Not important, just an observation.

# {{ book.glossary.iot }}
Internet of Things (IoT) is a semi-complicated term, with a less than simple definition. To *put* it simply, however, an IoT device is one which can be monitored, controlled, and/or maintained remotely using the Internet. 

# {{ book.glossary.cms }}
Content Management Systems (CMS), at their most basic level, *manage* content. More expansive CMS, like Drupal, take the next logical step of collecting and publishing the content in different formats. Publishing format examples are: IoT, websites, web-applications, an Intranet, Web Portals, video games, and even desktop applications
